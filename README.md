# Pharmkit
## Created by David Rozmajzl

## Install Dependencies:
(You need Xcode 11.4 to run this app)
You must have cocoapods installed to install the dependencies that Pharmkit needs to run.

To *install cocoapods*:

    $ sudo gem install cocoapods

After installation is complete you need navigate to the project folder on your machine.
Run the following command (This may take a while):

    $ pod install

## Run the app
After the pods are installed, click on the file "drugInteractions.xcworkspace". *DO NOT* click on the 
similarly named file, "drugInteractions.xcodeproj".

Once in Xcode, choose your simulated device and click the run button.
The first compilation will take a while.
